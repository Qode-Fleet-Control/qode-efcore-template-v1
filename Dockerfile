# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml and pushed to Artifact Registry.
#
# A JOB image: its default command applies the EF Core migrations and runs the console
# job, then exits 0 (non-zero on any error). It serves no HTTP.
#   - two stages, as Microsoft's container docs teach: publish on the SDK image, run on the
#     slim .NET runtime image (migrations are compiled into App.dll and applied with
#     Database.Migrate(), so dotnet-ef is not needed at run time);
#   - SQLite by default, in /app/data (SQLITE_PATH); PostgreSQL when DATABASE_URL is set;
#   - runs as the image's built-in non-root `app` user ($APP_UID).
